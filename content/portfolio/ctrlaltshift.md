Ctrl Alt Shift is a not-for-profit with a mission to inspire a generation of passionate, informed and outspoken young people. Our aim was to cultivate a large stimulated and active community to lead opinion, take action and initiate real social and political change. This would grow from a central online hub led by a compelling editorial voice and encouraging contribution, conversation and participation.

We wrote a detailed [blog post](/blog/ctrlaltshift-drupal-case-study) explaining the process we used to design, build and deliver this project.
