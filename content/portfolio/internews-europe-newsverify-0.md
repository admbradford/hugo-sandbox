NewsVerify is a news publishing platform with a verification framework. It is an open-source product, created in partnership with [Internews Europe](http://www.internews.eu/), and based on [Drupal](/services/drupal-development-london-uk). 

It has been deployed for multiple partners in the Middle East region. [The code](https://github.com/atchai/newsverify) is available for free on Github. 

NewsVerify acknowledges the positive contribution citizen journalism is making to todays information landscape, and attempts to address the lack of fact-checking and verification in social media sources. It also addresses the delay media organisations face when publishing stories emerging from non-traditional channels. By ensuring that the verification status is transparent, it is possible to publish earlier, while further fact-checking is undertaken, maintaining credibility and keeping readers informed. 

NewsVerify allows you to curate pieces of evidence from social media and the web, and tie them together as a news Event. An event has a verification status and narrative which can be updated as more evidence is added. Events can be collected together to form a Story. A story allows you to tie events together with editorial analysis and original content.
