**[Slack](http://slack.com)** has rapidly become the most loved platform for enterprise messaging and collaboration.  It's 3 million daily active users spend an average of 140 minutes on Slack every work day. 

Within our own Slack team we found ourselves sharing a lot of links and then struggling to find them after a few weeks of messages had piled up on top.  The Slack search can work, if you know exactly what text was in, or around the link.  We wanted a simple way to keep track of all the links that we had shared in one place, so we built Sur.ly - a Slack bot that will sit in your channel and copy any links that are shared to a Google Doc the whole team can access. 

We used the excellent node.js botkit library, which provides both slack integration and facebook messenger integration - for more details see our blog post <a href="2016-07-01-develop-multi-team-slack-bots">Multi-team slack bots hosted with Beepboop</a>.

### Notes
* When adding the bot to your slack team you'll be asked to provide a Google Spreasheet ID - you can copy this from the spreadsheet's URL.
* Share your spreadsheet with: slinky@slack-slinky.iam.gserviceaccount.com
* Ensure that your spreadsheet has the following column headings:
      * timestamp
      * link 
      * full_message
