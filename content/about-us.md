Established in 2010, Atchai is a digital consultancy and development house based in London, UK.  We work closely with clients to [develop innovative digital products](/we-develop/product-development), specialising in [data-driven web applications](/we-develop/data-web-applications) and [conversational UI / chatbots](/we-develop/conversational-ui-chatbots).

Our work is driven by new technology, user centred design and [Agile methodologies](/about-us/how-we-work). What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up.  We are a small, specialised team and we offer a highly personal and collaborative service to our clients.

We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much.
