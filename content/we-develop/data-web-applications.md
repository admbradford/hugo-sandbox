## Smart and sophisticated
Modern apps need to do more than just look beautiful. Great <strong>user experience</strong> has become the standard, so in order to differentiate you need to build <strong>innovative technology</strong>.  We develop web applications that use <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing</strong>.  We work with you in an <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">Agile process</a>, providing full-stack product development.  

As the creators of <a href="https://getdataseed.com">Dataseed</a> - an award-winning <strong>data visualisation</strong> SaaS product, we can help you with all stages of bringing a new product to market.


## Cutting Edge Technology 
Our tech stack is constantly evolving - We embrace new technology and weâ€™re always learning.  For big data pipelines and machine learning / NLP at scale we use <strong>Apache Spark with Python</strong> and Scala, typically deployed on AWS.  We build <strong>micro-services</strong> that communicate via task queues such as RabbitMQ.  Modern datastores provide a wide range of options, we work a lot with <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.  Our web applications are moving towards a full-stack <strong>javascript</strong> approach, as <strong>Node.js</strong> reaches maturity.
