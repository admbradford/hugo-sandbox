## Rapid Innovation
Do you need a <strong>technical partner</strong> who can help you turn ideas into reality?  We work with you in an open, <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">collaborative Agile process</a>, delivering working software from the very first sprint.  We've even built <a href="https://getdataseed.com">our own SaaS start-up</a>, so we understand what's required to bring a new product to market - from <strong>validation</strong>, through to <strong>scaling for millions of users</strong>.

## Creative Technology
Our tech stack is constantly evolving - We embrace new technology and we're always learning.  We've built hardware devices with <a href="/blog/2016-02-03-john-coltrane-nicolas-slonimsky-and-the-arduino-part-2/">Arduino</a>, big data applications using <a href="/portfolio/parity-group-groupseer/">Apache Spark and Scala</a>, <a href="portfolio/mindbot/">chatbots with node.js</a>, and full scale apps using python, javascript and a wide range of modern data stores including Postgres, Elasticsearch, MongoDB.  If you're interested in a particular technology - just ask, we've probably used it!
