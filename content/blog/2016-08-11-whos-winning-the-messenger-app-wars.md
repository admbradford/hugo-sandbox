<h2 class="subtitle">A Review and Comparison of the Most Popular Chatbot Platforms</h2>

We now spend more time in messenger apps than we do on social media.  It’s [reported](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696477-market-apps-maturing-now-one-text-based-services-or-chatbots-looks-poised) that over 2.5 billion people have at least one messaging app installed. **By 2018, Activate [Forecasts](http://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/activate-tech-and-media-outlook-2016/7-Because_attention_is_highly_multitasked) that number to grow to 3.6 billion people.**

In this article, we examine the most popular messaging apps, providing the latest data on usage and demographics.  We also give an overview of the app's features and it's suitability as a platform upon which to [develop chatbots](/we-develop/conversational-ui-chatbots).

![Facebook Messenger Logo](/images/Facebook_Messenger_logo.jpg)

## [Facebook Messenger](https://en-gb.messenger.com/)

In 2016, an estimated **[50.5% of UK residents](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Than-Half-of-UK-Population-Will-Log-on-Facebook-This-Year/1013627) (33.2 million users)** will log on to Facebook each month. **[50.3% of Americans](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/This-Year-More-Than-Half-of-Americans-Will-Use-Facebook/1013560)** of all ages will be on Facebook at least once a month, up from 49.3% in 2015. 

Globally it is the most popular social network with **1.65 billion users of which [566 million users are in Asia
Pacific](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/social-media/facebook-nears-150-million-users-in-india-dan-neary/article8673625.ece).** In it's second quarter 2016 earnings Facebook reported that it now has **[1.57 billion monthly active users](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results.pdf)**. It was also reported that it has [1.13 billion daily active users](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results.pdf). 

> It was recently reported that Facebook Messenger now has [1 billion active users](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/20/12232130/facebook-messenger-one-billion-users). Messenger [added 100 million](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/20/12232130/facebook-messenger-one-billion-users) new users in the last three months and about the same for the period January 2016 to March 2016, indicating fairly steady growth.

In it’s first quarter earnings report Facebook announced that **on average its users spend about [50 minutes per day
across](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?_r=0) it’s apps (Facebook, Instagram and Facebook Messenger)**. At first glance this may not seem like a lot, but consider that there are only 24 hours in a day and the average person sleeps about 8.8 hours per day. 

> The average Facebook user spends roughly 5% of their waking hours across its apps (Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger)

Facebook Messenger was [first launched in August 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger). In April 2014 it was announced that the messaging functionality will be completely removed from Facebook and users will be forced to download Messenger. Although users were unhappy about this at the time, it doesn’t seem to have slowed down the app’s growth. Originally released to enable users to easily reach friends wherever they are the app has added a host of features to extend its use from purely social to a lifestyle app.

> [In 2015 a stack of new features](https://contently.com/strategist/2016/01/08/800-million-users-could-messenger-become-bigger-facebook/) were introduced meaning users spend even more time in the app: send & receive money, virtual business cards, transportation platform, business on messenger, message requests and [M](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/facebook-launches-m-new-kind-virtual-assistant/) to name a few.

In April 2016 Facebook announced the launch of its [bot platform](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/04/12/bots-for-messenger/) for Messenger. In the first three months since the launch, [more than 11,000 bots](http://venturebeat.com/2016/06/30/facebook-messenger-now-has-11000-chatbots-for-you-to-try/) have been built.

![WhatsApp Logo](/images/whatsapp-logo.jpg)

## [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

WhatsApp is an instant messaging platform for smartphones and desktop. Users can send text messages, documents, images, video, user location and audio messages to other users. Users can also make VoIP calls using the platform. It was founded in 2009 and was acquired by Facebook in February 2014.

WhatsApp has been slow to open itself up to businesses. In January 2016 it announced that it will [start testing
tools](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/01/18/whatsapp-businesses-free-1-billion/#b1caeab6bd11) this year to allow its users to communicate directly with businesses and organisations.  This is likely to mean that WhatsApp becomes a viable platform to build bots for towards the end of 2016.

![Skype Logo](/images/Skype-Logo.jpg)

## [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

> At the end of 2015 Skype reported that its users spent [3 billion minutes](http://blogs.skype.com/2015/12/17/2015-skypes-year-in-review/) on Skype calls each day.

Microsoft is turning Skype into a messaging bot platform. In March 2016, [it introduced the Skype Bot Program](http://qz.com/651098/microsoft-is-turning-skype-into-a-messaging-platform-and-as-usual-its-late-to-the-game/), a set of tools that lets developers build bots for Skype.

## And the next few years…

The number of people that have at least one messaging app installed is expected to grow to 3.6 billion by 2018. Put another way, that is a staggering **90% of the worlds internet enabled population** or nearly half the estimated world population ([7.56 billion](http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_history3.aspx))!

It’s a huge audience pool and services based on AI and NLP technology are improving rapidly. With the very real effects of [app fatigue](https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/app-fatigue/) being felt, chat-bots have become a very attractive option. Some are even asking whether chat-bots could be the [fifth wave of internet communication](http://www.vertoanalytics.com/chatbots-fifth-wave-internet-communications/)?

We believe that chatbots and messaging apps open up an important new channel to connect with users, but a good bot needs to satisfy all the traditional [criteria of a good product or service](2016-05-31-is-your-start-up-idea-really-worth-it).

## How do I choose the best bot platform?

Know your audience.  You can use the information in this article to short-list platforms that are popular with your audience but always spend some time using the apps as each has it's own ideosyncracies.  

Atchai is currently developing a cross-platform bot development kit that will make it easy to switch on or off multiple different messaging platforms for your bot.

## Can you help me build a bot?
Yes!  We're one of only a few [companies that specialise in building chat bots](/we-develop/conversational-ui-chatbots).

There are several bot-builder products out there. These products can create a very basic bots, and we recommend you try them out in case they are capable of building a first prototype. It's likely that you will quickly run into limitations that require a custom bot to be built.  

Working with a [professional chat-bot agency](/we-develop/conversational-ui-chatbots) we will help you identify the right platform, design a conversation flow and write copy with consistent tone of voice, and deploy a robust and mature tech platform that will scale to millions of users and maek use of the latest NLP and AI techniques.
