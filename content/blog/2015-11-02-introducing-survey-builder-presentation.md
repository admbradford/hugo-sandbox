title: "Introducing Survey Builder - Presentation"
---

[Survey Builder](http://drupal.org/project/survey_builder) is a Drupal 7 module that allows you to create surveys, questionnaires, or plain old forms using a drag and drop interface.  It makes use of the fantastic [form_builder](http://drupal.org/project/form_builder) module, with views and features integration, and rules integration planned.  Atchai has built this module and contributed it as open-source to the Drupal Community, first presented at the London Drupal Dropin event, held at Capgemini in December 2011.

Built specifically for [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0), making use of entities and [form_builder module](http://drupal.org/project/form_builder), with views integration allowing you to easily create your own interfaces and analytics.

Below are the slides from the presentation that Rob Hardwick and John Griffin gave at the [Drupal Drop-in event](http://drupaldropindecember2011.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn) at Capgemini in London on 12th December 2011.
