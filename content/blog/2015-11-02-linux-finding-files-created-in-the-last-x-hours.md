You cannot use the -ctype or -mtype modifiers if the timeframe youâ€™re interested in is within the last 24hrs.  If you want to find all files created in, say, the last two hours; magic up a file with the created time set to two hours ago like this:

`touch -t YYYYMMDDHHMM  t.tmp `

Then use find's -newer switch to look for files which are newer:

`find . -newer t.tmp`
